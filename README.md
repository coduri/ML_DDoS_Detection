# DDoS attacks detection and characterization

The provided dataset contains traffic traces collected during the execution of some of the most common DDoS attacks.

Each row is referred to a flow (sequence of packets exchanged between a source and a destination IP).

# Labels
The provided dataset is classified in 12 labels. 11 related to DDoS attacks (e.g., `ddos_ldap`, `ddos_udp`, ...).
The last one is `benign` and specifies that the labelled flow does not belong to any attack.

-   'Subflow Fwd Bytes': The number of bytes in the forward direction of a subflow of a network communication.

-   'Init_Win_bytes_forward': The initial window size (in bytes) in the forward direction of a network communication. The window size is a parameter that controls the amount of data that can be transmitted before an acknowledgement is required.
-   'Init_Win_bytes_backward': The initial window size (in bytes) in the backward direction of a network communication. The "backward" direction refers to the direction of the communication from the receiver back to the sender.
-   'act_data_pkt_fwd': The number of data packets in the forward direction of a network communication.
-   'min_seg_size_forward': The minimum size (in bytes) of a segment in the forward direction of a network communication. A segment is a unit of data that is transmitted between a sender and a receiver.
-   'Active Mean': The mean (average) value of the active time of a network communication. The active time is the amount of time that the communication is actively transferring data.
-   'Active Std': The standard deviation of the active time of a network communication. The standard deviation is a measure of the spread or dispersion of a set of values.
-   'Active Max': The maximum value of the active time of a network communication.
-   'Active Min': The minimum value of the active time of a network communication.
-   'Idle Mean': The mean (average) value of the idle time
-   'Idle Std': The standard deviation of the idle time of a network communication. The standard deviation is a measure of the spread or dispersion of a set of values. The idle time is the amount of time that the communication is not actively transferring data.
-   'Idle Max': The maximum value of the idle time of a network communication. The idle time is the amount of time that the communication is not actively transferring data.
-   'Idle Min': The minimum value of the idle time of a network communication. The idle time is the amount of time that the communication is not actively transferring data.
-   'SimillarHTTP': A measure of the similarity of the network communication to the HTTP protocol. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a widely-used protocol for transmitting data over the internet, particularly for web browsing.
-   'Inbound': A binary value indicating whether the network communication is inbound (1) or outbound (0). An inbound communication is one that is directed towards the device, while an outbound communication is one that is initiated by the device.
